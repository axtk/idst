*<ins>I</ins>mmutable <ins>d</ins>ata <ins>st</ins>ore for React apps*

ðŸ”¹ Wrap up shared data into `new Store(data)`, put it into a React Context;

ðŸ”¹ Read and subscribe to updates in the store:
```js
const [state, setState] = useStore(store);
```

Call `useStore(store, false)` to get `[state, setState]` without subscribing to updates in the store.

ðŸ”¹ Update parts of the shared data:
```js
setState({x: 10});
setState(state => ({x: state.x + 5}));
```

ðŸ”¹ Have as many stores as needed.
